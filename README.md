> ***EmbodiedGen*** is a generative engine to create diverse and interactive 3D worlds composed of high-quality 3D assets(mesh & 3DGS) with plausible physics, leveraging generative AI to address the challenges of generalization in embodied intelligence related research.
> It composed of six key modules: `Image-to-3D`, `Text-to-3D`, `Texture Generation`, `Articulated Object Generation`, `Scene Generation` and `Layout Generation`.

- [🌍 3D Scene Generation](#3d-scene-generation)
- [⚙️ Articulated Object Generation](#articulated-object-generation)
- [🏞️ Layout (Interactive 3D Worlds) Generation](#layout-generation)

## 🚀 Quick Start

### ✅ Setup Environment
```sh
git clone https://github.com/HorizonRobotics/EmbodiedGen.git
cd EmbodiedGen
git checkout v0.1.1
git submodule update --init --recursive --progress
conda create -n embodiedgen python=3.10.13 -y
conda activate embodiedgen
bash install.sh
```

### ✅ Setup GPT Agent

Update the API key in file: `embodied_gen/utils/gpt_config.yaml`.

You can choose between two backends for the GPT agent:

- **`gpt-4o`** (Recommended) – Use this if you have access to **Azure OpenAI**.
- **`qwen2.5-vl`** – An alternative with free usage via OpenRouter, apply a free key [here](https://openrouter.ai/settings/keys) and update `api_key` in `embodied_gen/utils/gpt_config.yaml` (50 free requests per day)

<h2 id="image-to-3d">🖼️ Image-to-3D</h2>

[![🤗 Hugging Face](https://img.shields.io/badge/🤗-Image_to_3D_Demo-blue)](https://huggingface.co/spaces/HorizonRobotics/EmbodiedGen-Image-to-3D) Generate physically plausible 3D asset URDF from single input image, offering high-quality support for digital twin systems.

<img src="apps/assets/image_to_3d.jpg" alt="Image to 3D" width="900">

### ☁️ Service
Run the image-to-3D generation service locally.
Models downloaded automatically on first run, please be patient.
```sh
# Run in foreground
python apps/image_to_3d.py
# Or run in the background
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 nohup python apps/image_to_3d.py > /dev/null 2>&1 &
```

### ⚡ API
Generate physically plausible 3D assets from image input via the command-line API.
```sh
img3d-cli --image_path apps/assets/example_image/sample_04.jpg apps/assets/example_image/sample_19.jpg \
    --n_retry 2 --output_root outputs/imageto3d

# See result(.urdf/mesh.obj/mesh.glb/gs.ply) in ${output_root}/sample_xx/result
```

<h2 id="text-to-3d">📝 Text-to-3D</h2>

[![🤗 Hugging Face](https://img.shields.io/badge/🤗-Text_to_3D_Demo-blue)](https://huggingface.co/spaces/HorizonRobotics/EmbodiedGen-Text-to-3D) Create 3D assets from text descriptions for a wide range of geometry and styles.

<img src="apps/assets/text_to_3d.jpg" alt="Text to 3D" width="900">

### ☁️ Service
Deploy the text-to-3D generation service locally.

Text-to-image model based on the Kolors model, supporting Chinese and English prompts.
Models downloaded automatically on first run, please be patient.
```sh
python apps/text_to_3d.py
```

### ⚡ API
Text-to-image model based on SD3.5 Medium, English prompts only.
Usage requires agreement to the [model license](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-3.5-medium), models downloaded automatically. (ps: models with more permissive licenses found in `embodied_gen/models/image_comm_model.py`)

```sh
text3d-cli --prompts "small bronze figurine of a lion" "A globe with wooden base" "wooden table with embroidery" \
    --n_image_retry 2 --n_asset_retry 2 --n_pipe_retry 1 --seed_img 0 \
    --output_root outputs/textto3d
```

Text-to-image model based on the Kolors model.
```sh
bash embodied_gen/scripts/textto3d.sh \
    --prompts "small bronze figurine of a lion" "A globe with wooden base and latitude and longitude lines" "橙色电动手钻，有磨损细节" \
    --output_root outputs/textto3d_k
```

Models downloaded automatically on first run, see `download_kolors_weights`, `geo_cond_mv`.
```sh
python apps/texture_edit.py
```

### ⚡ API
Support Chinese and English prompts.
```sh
bash embodied_gen/scripts/texture_gen.sh \
    --mesh_path "apps/assets/example_texture/meshes/robot_text.obj" \
    --prompt "举着牌子的写实风格机器人，大眼睛，牌子上写着“Hello”的文字" \
    --output_root "outputs/texture_gen/" \
    --uuid "robot_text"
```
